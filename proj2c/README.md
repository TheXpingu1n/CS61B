to make that work:

1- in main package run the main class 
2- then open ngordnet.html (in static folder) into the browser  

and Voila!

it works!!

*all of the options are working except hypoist as I didn't implement it till now as it's optional in the course to implement it*

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
-------------------
the data of the project must be in the same level of directories of static and out and src
