to make that work:
**download data first**
1- in main package run the main class 
2- then open ngordnet.html (in static folder) into the browser  
3- clone the library-sp24 and add it to the libraries from File -> Project Structure -> libraries and choose library-sp24 after cloning it
**************
library-sp24::
https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-sp24

and Voila!

it works!!

*all of the options are working except hypoist as I didn't implement it till now as it's optional in the course to implement it*

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
-------------------
the data of the project must be in the same level of directories of static and out and src

to download the data:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/155ZwViR90eoIpa1Si7dUAk7o0R04SEPG/view?usp=sharing

extract it and put it in proj2c folder before doing anything
